# Hi! I'm Nathan Stocks 👨🏻‍💻 👾 🎮 

I am a passionate Rustacean and author of [Rusty Engine], a Rust programming [instructor], open source maintainer, indie game developer, and Senior Software Engineer at GitHub. 

# 🚀 My Projects 

- [Rusty Engine] - 2D game engine for learning Rust
- [Green] (maintainer) - a clean, colorful, fast Python test runner.
- [Ultimate Rust Crash Course] - Open source exercises for [my course on Udemy]
- [Ultimate Rust 2] - Open source exercises for [my other course on Udemy]
- [Bevy Template] - An opinionated Bevy project template with a configuration script to run for the more complex parts (like setting up the fast-compile setup).
- [Invaders] - "Space Invaders" clone...in the terminal
- [Rusty Sword] - Conquer monsters in your terminal with your rusty sword
- [Punch Ball] - Punch your opponents out of the arena

I also contribute to various open source projects that I use, with the most notable one (in terms of my frequency and number of contributions) is [Bevy],  "A refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust". Come and play!
